ghdl -a hello.vhdl:
    This command creates or updates a file work-obj93.cf,
    which describes the library work. On GNU/Linux,
    this command generates a file hello.o, which is
    the object file corresponding to your VHDL program.
    The object file is not created on Windows.


    Then, you have to build an executable file.

ghdl -e hello_world


The -e option means elaborate. With this option,
GHDL creates code in order to elaborate a design,
with the hello_world entity at the top of the hierarchy.

  On GNU/Linux, if you have enabled the
  GCC backend during the compilation of
  GHDL, an executable program called
  hello_world which can be run is generated:
